## [LRN-20260322-001] knowledge_gap

**Logged**: 2026-03-22T21:31:30Z
**Priority**: medium
**Status**: pending
**Area**: backend

### Summary
gateway_status is a top-level agents column, not inside agent_card JSONB

### Details
During API cleanup, attempted to order by agent_card->>'gateway_status' but the field is actually a standalone column added in migration 20260321180000_a2a_columns.sql with values 'live' | 'offline'. The agent_card JSONB stores only the A2A/marketplace protocol fields.

### Suggested Action
When querying gateway_status, use the column directly. 'live' > 'offline' alphabetically so ORDER BY gateway_status DESC puts live agents first.
